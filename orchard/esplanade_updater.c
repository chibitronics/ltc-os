  Facts:
  -  The KL02 has 1k sectors.
  -  Data is marshalled in 256-byte blocks.
     - The 256-byte blocks are protected with a murmur3 hash check
     - This isn't cryptographically good, but probably good enough to make
       collisions due to random bit flips more rare than say, cables falling out
       or power loss during programming.
  -  Users will typically be using phones to program the stickers. It's not possible
     to guarantee silence on the headphone port, so a sound-based trigger to initiate
     programming is ruled out (imagine if every time you get a notification, your
     project flips into programming mode; pretty annoying).

  Transmission format:
  - Two types of blocks: data, and control
    - Data block consists of:
      -- Preamble Sync (00, 00, 00, 00, aa, 55, 42)
      -- Version code (1 byte: 0x00-0x7f)
      -- Block offset (2 bytes): address offset = (block offset * 256 bytes + app code base)
      -- Data (256 bytes)
      -- Hash check (4 bytes -- covers version code through end of data)
    - Control block consists of:
      -- Preamble Sync (00, 00, 00, 00, aa, 55, 42)
      -- Version code (1 byte: 0x80-0xff)
      -- Total block count for this transmission (2 bytes)
      -- Final code region hash (4 bytes)
      -- md5sum of code region (20 bytes) -- used to ID programs

  Memory allocation:
    note: code defensively so these limits can be easily changed anytime from now until spec freeze
    spec freeze happens upon first production run
  00k
    22k for Bootstrapping ocde
  22k
    256 bytes for signature & management
  22.25k
    256 bytes for interrupt vector relocation table (via VTOR)
  22.5k
    9.5k for User application code (including any arduino libraries that have to stay resident)
  32k

  Programming Algorithm:
  - Unit boots to programing mode and searches with a timeout of 5s for a carrier tone;
    failing a carrier, it will revert to run mode if and only if a valid program already exists
    *** THIS MEANS COMPILE AND PROGRAM BUTTONS MUST BE DIFFERENT ON WEB UI *** as compiles could
    take longer than 5 seconds
  - Once a valid block is received:
    - Upon receipt of control block, check that md5 of sending block is different from current block
      (to avoid playback loops from reprogramming the system over and over again)
    - Upon receipt of unique md5, /all/ of program flash is erased
    - The blocks are written to flash based on received address until all expected blocks are received
    - System exits program mode once all blocks are received and starts running user code

  New proposed programming method:
  - Assume the presence of an external circuit which takes an external button, and provides two
    views on it: a pulsed version, and the current level
    -- the pulsed version is wired to RESET
    -- the current level is fed into a GPIO
  - On boot or reset, check the current level of the external button.
    - If it's held down for more than 1s, go into programming mode, and stay there.
    - Otherwise, go into application run mode and never come back

  Thus, press-and-hold to program; tap to reset to app; and also, power cycle to reset to app.
  Also, once program is successful, automatically start the app. woot!
